I'm learning [**go**](https://golang.org) this year. This repo contains my learning exercises, from the excellent book [**Exercises for Programmers** - _57 Challenges to Develop Your Coding Skills_](https://pragprog.com/book/bhwb/exercises-for-programmers) by _Brian P. Hogan_.

> **NOTE:** I'm _learning_ go right now. Maybe you are an experienced go programmer, landing here by accident, reading code and thinking to yourself "_this is shitty code_". Yeah, I know - learning, right? But if you see something _really_ shitty, leave a comment on the code. :)
